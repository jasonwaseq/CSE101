## README.md  
README.md will list each file submitted, together with a brief description of its role in the project. README.md is essentially a table of contents for the project.  

## Makefile  
A Makefile is a file used by the make utility to automate the process of compiling and building a program. It defines rules for how to compile and link source code files into an executable.   

## Arithmetic.cpp   
Handles BigInteger arithmetic by reading input from a file, performing operations using BigInteger.cpp functions, and writing results to an output file.   

## BigInteger.cpp   
Defines the BigInteger ADT, which can store large numbers using a signum integer and a list of digits formatted according to the POWER constant. Includes constructors and data manipulation methods.   

## BigInteger.h  
Header file defining the functions implemented in BigInteger.cpp.  

## BigIntegerTest.cpp  
Tests all functions in BigInteger.cpp. The code is based on Patrick Tantalo's provided BigIntegerClient.  

## List.h   
This header file declares the functions defined in List.cpp.  

## List.cpp  
This C++ file implements the List Abstract Data Type as a doubly linked list with a cursor positioned between elements. It includes constructors, destructors, access, and data manipulation functions to execute list operations.    

## ListTest.cpp    
This C++ file tests the functionality of all the functions in List.cpp. The code is based on Patrick Tantalo's provided ListClient.
