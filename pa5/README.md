## README.md  
README.md will list each file submitted, together with a brief description of its role in the project. README.md is essentially a table of contents for the project.  

## Makefile  
A Makefile is a file used by the make utility to automate the process of compiling and building a program. It defines rules for how to compile and link source code files into an executable.   

## List.h  
This header file declares the functions defined in List.cpp.  

## List.cpp  
This C++ file implements the List Abstract Data Type as a doubly linked list with a cursor positioned between elements. It includes constructors, destructors, access, and data manipulation functions to execute list operations.  

## ListTest.cpp  
This C++ file tests the functionality of all the functions in List.cpp. The code is based on Patrick Tantalo's provided ListClient.  

## Shuffle.cpp   
This C++ file takes an integer input n, representing the deck size, and calculates the number of perfect (riffle) shuffles required for each deck size from 1 to n. It includes a shuffle function that performs the shuffling process and a main function that formats the output and calls the shuffle function.
