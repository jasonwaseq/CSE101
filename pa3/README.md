## README.md  
README.md will list each file submitted, together with a brief description of its role in the project. README.md is essentially a table of contents for the project, and nothing more.  

## Makefile  
A Makefile is a file used by the make utility to automate the process of compiling and building a program. It defines rules for how to compile and link source code files into an executable.  

## List.h  
This header file declares the functions defined in List.c.  

## List.c   
This C file implements the List ADT as a doubly linked list with a cursor. It includes constructors, destructors, and functions for data access and manipulation. 

 ## Graph.h  
This header file declares the functions defined in Graph.c.  

## Graph.c  
This C file constructs the Graph structure using an adjacency list representation, incorporating vertices, edges, and arcs. It includes constructors, destructors, access and data manipulation functions. A Depth First Search (DFS) function is implemented to explore vertex neighbors.  

## GraphTest.c  
This C file tests the functionality of all functions in Graph.c. The testing framework and format are adapted from Tantaloâ€™s GraphClient code.  

## FindComponents.c  
This C file processes input and output files to read graph data, including vertices, edges, and arcs. It generates the adjacency list representation of the graph and identifies its strongly connected components.
