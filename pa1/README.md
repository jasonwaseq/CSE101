## README.md  
README.md will list each file submitted, together with a brief description of its role in the project.  
README.md is essentially a table of contents for the project, and nothing more.  

## List.h  
The header file containing all the functions that are in List.c.  

## List.c  
Contains code for a doubly linked list with a cursor element that builds the List ADT. In this code there are access functions, manipulation functions, constructor functions, destructor functions, and other functions.  

## Lex.c  
Contains code to take in an input file and an output file for the program to sort lexicographically line by line. The program then prints the lexicographically sorted input into the output file.

## ListTest.c  
Contains code used to test the functionality of every function in the List.c file. The code is based upon the professor's ListClient.c file.  

## Makefile  
A Makefile is a file used by the make utility to automate the process of compiling and building a program. It defines rules for how to compile and link source code files into an executable.
