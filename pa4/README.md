## README.md  
README.md will list each file submitted, together with a brief description of its role in the project. README.md is essentially a table of contents for the project.  

## Makefile  
A Makefile is a file used by the make utility to automate the process of compiling and building a program. It defines rules for how to compile and link source code files into an executable.   

## Sparse.c  
This C file handles input and output operations for reading matrix data, including size, nonzero elements (nnz), and entries. It performs various mathematical operations on the given matrices. 

## Matrix.c  
This C file defines a Matrix structure using an adjacency list representation, incorporating vertices, edges, and arcs. It includes constructor, destructor, access, and data manipulation functions. It has a Breadth-First Search (BFS) function to explore vertex neighbors.  

## Matrix.h  
This header file contains function prototypes for Matrix.c.  

## MatrixTest.c  
This C file tests the functionality of all functions in Matrix.c. The test structure is based on Patrick Tantalo's MatrixClient code.  

## List.c  
This C file implements a List ADT as a doubly linked list with a cursor. It includes constructor, destructor functions, access and data manipulation functions.  

## List.h  
This header file contains function prototypes for List.c.  

## ListTest.c  
This C file tests the functionality of all functions in the modified List.c file. The test structure is based on Patrick Tantalo's ListClient code.
